## 📝 Project Brief: “LocalBites” – Restaurant Menu Web App

**Client:** LocalBites, a small family-owned restaurant in your town.  
**Goal:** They want a simple, mobile-friendly web app where customers can view the daily menu and contact the restaurant.  
**Deadline:** 5 days from “today.”  
**Budget:** €0 (they’re paying you in free meals — you agreed because you want portfolio work).

### **Requirements**
1. **Homepage**  
   - Restaurant name, logo, and a short welcome message.  
   - A “View Menu” button.  

2. **Menu Page**  
   - Displays today’s menu items (pulled from a simple JSON file or Python list).  
   - Each item shows: name, description, and price.  

3. **Contact Page**  
   - Restaurant address, phone number, and a contact form (name, email, message).  
   - Form doesn’t need to send real emails — just show a “Message sent!” confirmation.  

4. **Tech Stack**  
   - **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
   - **Frontend:** HTML + CSS (Bootstrap optional)  
   - **Data:** Menu stored in a JSON file or Python dictionary.  

5. **Bonus (Optional)**  
   - Add a “Daily Special” section that highlights one menu item.  
   - Make it responsive so it looks good on mobile.  

---

### **Deliverables**
- A working Flask app that runs locally.  
- Clear instructions in a `README.md` on how to run it.  
- Screenshots of the app in action for the client.

### **Client Notes**
> “We’re not tech people. We just want something simple that looks nice and works on our phones. If we like it, maybe we’ll ask you to add online ordering later.”

If you want, I can **act as your client** during this project — you can send me updates, and I’ll give you “client feedback” so it feels like a real back-and-forth.  

Do you want me to also give you a **step-by-step day plan** so you can finish this in under a week without burning out? That way it’ll feel like a real freelance timeline.
